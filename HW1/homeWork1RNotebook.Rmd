```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load the library(s)

```{r load library}
library(foreign) ## Will be used to load .sav file
library(ggplot2) ## Will be used for plotting
print("Done loading librarys")
```

```{r load data}
all.dat <- read.spss("./salary.sav", to.data.frame=T)
## I am now going to write a csv, so I can upload this to github and have the data in a remote location
write.csv(all.data, "./salary.csv", quote=F, row.names=F)
all.dat <- read.csv('./salary.csv')
```


## The following ssections will be used to answer Problem #1
```{r 1A produce mean, median, and variance}
mean.salary <- mean(all.dat$salary)
median.salary <- median(all.dat$salary)
var.salary <- var(all.dat$salary)
print(paste("The mean of salary is: ", mean.salary))
print(paste("The median of salary is: ", median.salary))
print(paste("The variance of salary is: ", var.salary))

```
```{r 1B plot and describe the salary variable, echo=FALSE}
hist(all.dat$salary)
boxplot(all.dat$salary)
qqnorm(all.dat$salary)
print(paste("These data appear to be relativley normal although there is one lower bound outlier"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
